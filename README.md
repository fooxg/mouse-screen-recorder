# Screen recorder
This script captures area around mouse cursor using mss library and saves captured frames as images. Code is able to capture smooth framerate on desktop and fullscreen applications. Right now it is only tested on Windows. 

## Requirements
mss (ver 5.1 was used originally)

## To do
- [x] Add script to render gifs or movies from set of image frames
- [ ] Improve gif optimization
- [ ] Ensure multiplatform support
- [ ] Add shortkeys support

Probably due to excellent quality and size of created gifs using gimp library in python is a way to go, so this will be object of focus for next update.

## Use
Script was written with `argparse` library, so you can always type `python main.py -h` for help with arguments. In default mode screen capture is set to record square part of the screen **400x400** for **10 seconds**. To set record mode for *2 seconds* with *500x500* resolution use:

```console
python main.py -s 500 -t 2
```

Script capture frames and saves them in __*img*__ folder in main directory. To additionally create a gif from images add flag `-m True`

Output result rendered in GIMP:

## Gif note

Current approach of rendering gifs with pillow library is not perfect. It is fast indeed, but makes artifacts on image and produce bigger files than gifs rendered with GIMP. GIF rendered with pillow can be seen below:
